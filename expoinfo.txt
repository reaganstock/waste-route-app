Expo Location


A library that provides access to reading geolocation information, polling current location or subscribing location update events from the device.

expo-location allows reading geolocation information from the device. Your app can poll for the current location or subscribe to location update events.

Installation
Terminal

Copy

npx expo install expo-location
If you are installing this in an existing React Native app, start by installing expo in your project. Then, follow the additional instructions as mentioned by the library's README under "Installation in bare React Native projects" section.

Configuration in app config
You can configure expo-location using its built-in config plugin if you use config plugins in your project (EAS Build or npx expo run:[android|ios]). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect.

Example app.json with config plugin
app.json

Copy


{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-location",
        {
          "locationAlwaysAndWhenInUsePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}

Are you using this library in a bare React Native app?
Background location
Background location allows your app to receive location updates while it is running in the background and includes both location updates and region monitoring through geofencing. This feature is subject to platform API limitations and system constraints:

Background location will stop if the user terminates the app.
Background location resumes if the user restarts the app.
 A terminated app will not automatically restart when a location or geofencing event occurs due to platform limitations.
 The system will restart the terminated app when a new geofence event occurs.
On Android, the result of removing an app from the recent apps list varies by device vendor. For example, some implementations treat removing an app from the recent apps list as killing it. Read more about these differences here: https://dontkillmyapp.com.
Background location configuration 
To be able to run background location on iOS, you need to add the location value to the UIBackgroundModes array in your app's Info.plist file.

If you're using CNG, the required UIBackgroundModes configuration will be applied automatically by prebuild.

Configure UIBackgroundModes manually on iOS
Background location methods
To use Background Location methods, the following requirements apply:

Location permissions must be granted.
Background location task must be defined in the top-level scope, using TaskManager.defineTask.
"location" background mode must be specified in Info.plist file. See Background location configuration.
You must use a development build to use background location since it is not supported in the Expo Go app.
Geofencing methods
To use Geofencing methods, the following requirements apply:

Location permissions must be granted.
The Geofencing task must be defined in the top-level scope, using TaskManager.defineTask.
When using Geofencing, the following platform differences apply:

 You are allowed up to 100 active geofences per app.
 Expo Location will report the initial state of the registered geofence(s) at app startup.
 There is a limit of 20 regions that can be simultaneously monitored.
Background permissions
To use location tracking or Geofencing in the background, you must request the appropriate permissions:

On Android, you must request both foreground and background permissions.
On iOS, it must be granted with the Always option using requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync.
Usage
If you're using the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, ensure that Location is enabled.

Hooks
useBackgroundPermissions(options)
Parameter	Type
options
(optional)
PermissionHookOptions<object>

Check or request permissions for the background location. This uses both requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync and getBackgroundPermissionsAsync to interact with the permissions.

Returns:
[null | PermissionResponse, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]
Example

const [status, requestPermission] = Location.useBackgroundPermissions();
useForegroundPermissions(options)
Parameter	Type
options
(optional)
PermissionHookOptions<object>

Check or request permissions for the foreground location. This uses both requestForegroundPermissionsAsync and getForegroundPermissionsAsync to interact with the permissions.

Returns:
[null | LocationPermissionResponse, RequestPermissionMethod<LocationPermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<LocationPermissionResponse>]
Example

const [status, requestPermission] = Location.useForegroundPermissions();
Methods
Location.enableNetworkProviderAsync()
Asks the user to turn on high accuracy location mode which enables network provider that uses Google Play services to improve location accuracy and location-based services.

Returns:
Promise<void>
A promise resolving as soon as the user accepts the dialog. Rejects if denied.

Location.geocodeAsync(address)
Parameter	Type	Description
address	string	
A string representing address, eg. "Baker Street London".


Geocode an address string to latitude-longitude location.

On Android, you must request location permissions with requestForegroundPermissionsAsync before geocoding can be used.

Note: Geocoding is resource consuming and has to be used reasonably. Creating too many requests at a time can result in an error, so they have to be managed properly. It's also discouraged to use geocoding while the app is in the background and its results won't be shown to the user immediately.

Returns:
Promise<LocationGeocodedLocation[]>
A promise which fulfills with an array (in most cases its size is 1) of LocationGeocodedLocation objects.

Location.getBackgroundPermissionsAsync()
Checks user's permissions for accessing location while the app is in the background.

Returns:
Promise<PermissionResponse>
A promise that fulfills with an object of type PermissionResponse.

Location.getCurrentPositionAsync(options)
Parameter	Type
options
(optional)
LocationOptions

Requests for one-time delivery of the user's current location. Depending on given accuracy option it may take some time to resolve, especially when you're inside a building.

Note: Calling it causes the location manager to obtain a location fix which may take several seconds. Consider using getLastKnownPositionAsync if you expect to get a quick response and high accuracy is not required.

Returns:
Promise<LocationObject>
A promise which fulfills with an object of type LocationObject.

Location.getForegroundPermissionsAsync()
Checks user's permissions for accessing location while the app is in the foreground.

Returns:
Promise<LocationPermissionResponse>
A promise that fulfills with an object of type LocationPermissionResponse.

Location.getHeadingAsync()
Gets the current heading information from the device. To simplify, it calls watchHeadingAsync and waits for a couple of updates, and then returns the one that is accurate enough.

Returns:
Promise<LocationHeadingObject>
A promise which fulfills with an object of type LocationHeadingObject.

Location.getLastKnownPositionAsync(options)
Parameter	Type
options
(optional)
LocationLastKnownOptions

Gets the last known position of the device or null if it's not available or doesn't match given requirements such as maximum age or required accuracy. It's considered to be faster than getCurrentPositionAsync as it doesn't request for the current location, but keep in mind the returned location may not be up-to-date.

Returns:
Promise<LocationObject | null>
A promise which fulfills with an object of type LocationObject or null if it's not available or doesn't match given requirements such as maximum age or required accuracy.

Location.getProviderStatusAsync()
Check status of location providers.

Returns:
Promise<LocationProviderStatus>
A promise which fulfills with an object of type LocationProviderStatus.

Location.hasServicesEnabledAsync()
Checks whether location services are enabled by the user.

Returns:
Promise<boolean>
A promise which fulfills to true if location services are enabled on the device, or false if not.

Location.hasStartedGeofencingAsync(taskName)
Parameter	Type	Description
taskName	string	
Name of the geofencing task to check.


Returns:
Promise<boolean>
A promise which fulfills with boolean value indicating whether the geofencing task is started or not.

Location.hasStartedLocationUpdatesAsync(taskName)
Parameter	Type	Description
taskName	string	
Name of the location task to check.


Returns:
Promise<boolean>
A promise which fulfills with boolean value indicating whether the location task is started or not.

Location.installWebGeolocationPolyfill()
Polyfills navigator.geolocation for interop with the core React Native and Web API approach to geolocation.

Returns:
void
Location.isBackgroundLocationAvailableAsync()
Returns:
Promise<boolean>
Location.requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync()
Asks the user to grant permissions for location while the app is in the background. On Android 11 or higher: this method will open the system settings page - before that happens you should explain to the user why your application needs background location permission. For example, you can use Modal component from react-native to do that.

Note: Foreground permissions should be granted before asking for the background permissions (your app can't obtain background permission without foreground permission).

Returns:
Promise<PermissionResponse>
A promise that fulfills with an object of type PermissionResponse.

Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync()
Asks the user to grant permissions for location while the app is in the foreground.

Returns:
Promise<LocationPermissionResponse>
A promise that fulfills with an object of type LocationPermissionResponse.

Location.reverseGeocodeAsync(location)
Parameter	Type	Description
location	Pick<LocationGeocodedLocation, 'latitude' | 'longitude'>	
An object representing a location.


Reverse geocode a location to postal address.

On Android, you must request location permissions with requestForegroundPermissionsAsync before geocoding can be used.

Note: Geocoding is resource consuming and has to be used reasonably. Creating too many requests at a time can result in an error, so they have to be managed properly. It's also discouraged to use geocoding while the app is in the background and its results won't be shown to the user immediately.

Returns:
Promise<LocationGeocodedAddress[]>
A promise which fulfills with an array (in most cases its size is 1) of LocationGeocodedAddress objects.

Default:
[]

Starts geofencing for given regions. When the new event comes, the task with specified name will be called with the region that the device enter to or exit from. If you want to add or remove regions from already running geofencing task, you can just call startGeofencingAsync again with the new array of regions.

Task parameters
Geofencing task will be receiving following data:

eventType - Indicates the reason for calling the task, which can be triggered by entering or exiting the region. See GeofencingEventType.
region - Object containing details about updated region. See LocationRegion for more details.

Permissions
Android
Foreground and background services are not available in Expo Go for Android. Instead, we recommend using a development build to avoid limitations.
When you install the expo-location module, it automatically adds the following permissions:

ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION: for approximate device location
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION: for precise device location
The following permissions are optional:

FOREGROUND_SERVICE and FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION: to be able to access location while the app is open but backgrounded. FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION is only required as of Android 14. When you enable this in a new build, you will need to submit your app for review and request access to use the foreground service permission.
ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION: to be able to access location while the app is backgrounded or closed. When you enable this in a new build, you will need to submit your app for review and request access to use the background location permission.
Android Permission	Description
ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

Allows an app to access approximate location.

Alternatively, you might want ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION

Allows an app to access precise location.

Alternatively, you might want ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION.
FOREGROUND_SERVICE

Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.
FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION

Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground with the type "location".

Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground with the type "location".
ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION

Allows an app to access location in the background.

If you're requesting this permission, you must also request either ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION. Requesting this permission by itself doesn't give you location access.
Excluding a permission
Note: Excluding a required permission from a module in your app can break the functionality corresponding to that permission. Always make sure to include all permissions a module is dependent on.

When your Expo project doesn't benefit from having particular permission included, you can omit it. For example, if your application doesn't need access to the precise location, you can exclude the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission.

Another example can be stated using available location accuracies. Android defines the approximate location accuracy estimation within about 3 square kilometers, and the precise location accuracy estimation within about 50 meters. For example, if the location accuracy value is Low, you can exclude ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission. To learn more about levels of location accuracies, see Android documentation.

To learn more on how to exclude permission, see Excluding Android permissions.

Expo Maps


A library that provides access to Google Maps on Android and Apple Maps on iOS.

Expo Maps is currently in alpha and subject to breaking changes. It is not available in the Expo Go app.
Installation
Terminal

Copy

npx expo install expo-maps
If you are installing this in an existing React Native app, start by installing expo in your project. Then, follow the additional instructions as mentioned by the library's README under "Installation in bare React Native projects" section.

Configuration
Expo Maps provides access to the platform native map APIs on Android and iOS.

Apple Maps (available on 
 only). No additional configuration is required to use it after installing this package.
Google Maps (available on 
 only). While Google provides a Google Maps SDK for iOS, Expo Maps supports it exclusively on Android. If you want to use Google Maps on iOS, you can look into using an alternative library or writing your own.
Google Cloud API setup
Before you can use Google Maps on Android, you need to register a Google Cloud API project, enable the Maps SDK for Android, and add the associated configuration to your Expo project.

Set up Google Maps on Android
Permissions
To display the user's location on the map, you need to declare and request location permission beforehand. You can configure this using the built-in config plugin if you use config plugins in your project (EAS Build or npx expo run:[android|ios]). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect.

Example app.json with config plugin
app.json

Copy


{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-maps",
        {
          "requestLocationPermission": "true",
          "locationPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
Configurable properties
Name	Default	Description
requestLocationPermission	false	
A boolean to add permissions to AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist.

locationPermission	"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"	
Only for: 

A string to set the NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription permission message.

To show the user's location on the map, the expo-maps library requires the following permissions:

ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION: for approximate device location
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION: for precise device location
Android Permission	Description
ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

Allows an app to access approximate location.

Alternatively, you might want ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION

Allows an app to access precise location.

Alternatively, you might want ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION.
FOREGROUND_SERVICE

Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.
FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION

Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground with the type "location".

Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground with the type "location".
ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION

Allows an app to access location in the background.

If you're requesting this permission, you must also request either ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION. Requesting this permission by itself doesn't give you location access.
